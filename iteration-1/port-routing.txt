To Get Initial Port Routing Working:

iptables -A INPUT -i ath0 -p udp --dport 5556 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i ath0 -p udp --dport 5556 -j REDIRECT --to-port 6666

Since this is on "ath0", hopefully loopback packets will still work :)

=> There is now a script in "bin" that handles this.  Don't do it manually!
