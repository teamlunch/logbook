James did some general setup:
   - Suggested a logo for the team
   - Created a this logbook on GitHub
   - Uploaded the "Iteration -1" project, including the cross-compiled libusb and libphidgets



========================================================================================
Monday, September 17th, 2012

The team had a start-up meeting, and discussed the following items:

General Discussion:
   - We need to distribute the VM Image to everyone
   - We already have our toolchain for the quadcopter
      - But not for the Tablet... worry about this later
   - James made a website at http://teamlunch.github.com
   - Everyone wants to code/write reports - we won't be specializing within the team
   - Everyone needs to make sure they're comfortable with using Git

Purchasing;
   - Right now, have one copter, one sensor controller, one IR sensor, one ultrasonic sensor
   - We should get a second one so we can keep working if we break the first one

Project Methodology and Scheduling:
   - We'll use Agile to drive the project; submit reports as necessary

Coding Conventions:
   - Use CDL Standards
      - Tabs are 3 spaces
      - Curly-braces on their own lines
      - Constants are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
      - ClassNamesAreCamelCase, membersStartsWithALowerCase
      - membersHaveAnUnderscoreAtTheEnd_
      - if (statementsHaveASpaceBeforeTheBracket)
      - Aim for lots of small functions
      - Acryonyms are capitalized like words (i.e. it's OpenGl, not OpenGL)

How we'll get started on the actual project:
   - Get Rami, Adam and Jennifer compiling on the VM
   - Start by making a proxy server that just eats commands

   We might be able to break the project into three things:
      - The software on the drone
      - The physical sensors
      - Unit/Acceptance Testing

   We'll discuss this more on Wednesday, once everyone has the VM.

Action Items:
   - Jennifer will write a draft of our Team Constitution
   - James will buy one more quadcopter
   - James will get a real copy of CDL's coding conventions

Monday, September 24th, 2012

Held a Team Meeting
   - Will work on project Tuesday/Thursday from 3:30 - 5:00
   - Will talk about project on Monday/Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00
   - This schedule is really inconvenient, but we can't actually get much done in only
     an hour :(

First Iteration Things to Do
   Sensors
   - Get the ultrasonic sensor soldered and working
   - Compare against the IR sensor, determine which is best

   Autopilot Command Proxy
   - Get iptable routing working on the drone
   - Figure out how to parse AT commands
   - Create a sample application that eats operator commands (as a proof-of-concept)

   Environment and Tools
   - Get make/cmake/bjam/tup/something working to build the project (Adam)
   - Clean up the deployment script
   - Investigate automated acceptance tests (AATs) over the whole application
      - Use a simulator?
      - Just test inputs/outputs?
      - Both?

Second Iteration Things to Do
   Sensor Layout
   - Figure out what is best

   Collision Avoidance
   - Develop the algorithm
   - Make it actually work

Going Forward
   - Do the "First Iteration" things tomorrow 
   - Will meet tomorrow at 12:00 noon to begin work

   - Will gain experience with AR.Drone for remainder of meeting

Project Work Period

Adam investigated getting make working for the project 
   - Looks like it should work
   - Cross-platform works out of the box

James started working on IpTables stuff
   - Managed to redirect the main command port to a dead port; successfully confusing
     the AR.FreeFlight control app.
   - Began writing a sample proxy application that prints out commands, and eats 
     some of them
   - Notes are kept in iteration-1/port-routing.txt

Jennifer and Rami started learning how Git works


========================================================================================
Wednesday, September 26th, 2012

Team received first assignment, began work
   - Project proposal is already written and contains a good start
   - Will create google doc


Continued work on IpTables stuff
   - We can now successfully proxy the control commands
   - This means the last actual roadblock has now been lifted
   - Yay!
   
========================================================================================
Thursday, September 27th, 2012

Continued work on sensor selection
   -Soldered the ultrasonic sensor to the control cable
   -Did testing with both the ultrasonic and infrared sensors
   -The ultrasonic sensors appears to be the clear winner
   -Decided to purchase the embedded sensor controller board as well as more ultrasonic
    sensors for further testing 
    
Action Items
   -Buy Embedded sensor controller board
   -Buy 4 - 5 more ultrasonic sensors
   
========================================================================================
Monday, October 1st, 2012

James order the embedded sensor controller board as well as 5 more ultrasonic sensors.

Talked about what type of tablet would be best for our project
   -Possibly one of the google Nexus 7's
   -Asus tablets seem like the best as they are close to stock android
   -Decided on a Asus 10.1 inch tablet from best buy
   
Informed our customer that we should have a demo available within the next month.
   

   
========================================================================================
Wednesday, October 3st, 2012

James will pick up all purchases immidately after the meeting

Discussed risk & reporting requirements
   - Team will manage risk by prototyping risky parts of project immidately
      -> This is the Agile Way(tm)
      -> This is also how our customer requested we proceed

   - Team will write the report after reporting requirements have been finalized 

Started working on the project
   - Found a unit testing framework (UnitTest++)
   - Created basic project structure
   - Successfully ran a 'hello world' acceptance test


========================================================================================
Thursday, October 4th, 2012

Received sensors from Phidgets
   - Got Warren (the helpful lab tech) to solder them to cables for us 
   - Researched how to connect sensors to embedded board
   - Researched how to physically mount sensors to the 'copter frame
   - Discussed options for full-size vs embedded board 

Unpacked other 'copter, discussed battery charging regime
   - Fresh batteries go on the specially marked pad


========================================================================================
Wednesday, October 10th, 2012

Team investigated the latest report assignment

Next Major Milestone - Full Suite of Sensors 
   - Get the 'copter talking to all five sensors 
   - Write an accompanying acceptance test 
   - Mount all sensors on the actual frame 
   - Doesn't need to fly; just needs to report readings

========================================================================================
Monday, October 15th, 2012

-Team decided on a time to finish up the backlog of assignments we havent finished
-We will meet on Tuesday Oct 23 at 3:15pm to start and finish all assignments that have been posted.
