James did some general setup:
   - Suggested a logo for the team
   - Created a this logbook on GitHub
   - Uploaded the "Iteration -1" project, including the cross-compiled libusb and libphidgets



========================================================================================
Monday, September 17th, 2012

The team had a start-up meeting, and discussed the following items:

General Discussion:
   - We need to distribute the VM Image to everyone
   - We already have our toolchain for the quadcopter
      - But not for the Tablet... worry about this later
   - James made a website at http://teamlunch.github.com
   - Everyone wants to code/write reports - we won't be specializing within the team
   - Everyone needs to make sure they're comfortable with using Git

Purchasing;
   - Right now, have one copter, one sensor controller, one IR sensor, one ultrasonic sensor
   - We should get a second one so we can keep working if we break the first one

Project Methodology and Scheduling:
   - We'll use Agile to drive the project; submit reports as necessary

Coding Conventions:
   - Use CDL Standards
      - Tabs are 3 spaces
      - Curly-braces on their own lines
      - Constants are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
      - ClassNamesAreCamelCase, membersStartsWithALowerCase
      - membersHaveAnUnderscoreAtTheEnd_
      - if (statementsHaveASpaceBeforeTheBracket)
      - Aim for lots of small functions
      - Acryonyms are capitalized like words (i.e. it's OpenGl, not OpenGL)

How we'll get started on the actual project:
   - Get Rami, Adam and Jennifer compiling on the VM
   - Start by making a proxy server that just eats commands

   We might be able to break the project into three things:
      - The software on the drone
      - The physical sensors
      - Unit/Acceptance Testing

   We'll discuss this more on Wednesday, once everyone has the VM.

Action Items:
   - Jennifer will write a draft of our Team Constitution
   - James will buy one more quadcopter
   - James will get a real copy of CDL's coding conventions

	-Tried different methods to attach sensors securely to the quadcopters frame.
	Method 1: use shrink wrap to attach sensors to frame
	Method 2: use double sided tape to attach sensors to frame.
	
	Conclusion: Method 2 was better as it was easier to attach the sensors. Method 1 was extremely tedious
			and the sensors did not feel completly secure.
	
	Quadcopter is ready for the embedded sensor board which needs to be soldered asap.

===============================================================================================
Wednesday, November 21, 2012

	-Discussed progress on project presentation
	-Rami was lazy and did not meet his requirements, everyone else had finished
	-Disscused allocationg of parts to do for report #2
	-Talked to Warren to arrange a time to have some soldering done for our embedded sensor board

	-James now has 6 passing acceptences for the command proxy, we should be able to attempt a test
	flight after we finish soldering.

Adam explored open source options to build upon for our android application, Adam was able to 
locate and compile/run a few open source applications that were made for the AR Drone 1.0 and would likely not 
work for our project since the API changed inbetween versions.

===============================================================================================
Sunday, January 13, 2013

A post was answered on the AR drone development website listing a new source for android development
   -http://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/projects/yadrone/

===============================================================================================
Tuesday, January 15, 2013

Team meeting: 1pm.  All members in attendance.
   -Tested out all of the android drone applications we found, none of the applications worked
   correctly.  However we eventually figured out that we were compiling yadrone for the wrong 
   android target and were able to use the application to successfully fly the drone.
   -We decided that we will scrap the sample android application that was supplied with the 
   yadrone framework and we would build our application from the ground up and use the framework
   in order to avoid having to reimplement all the commands that are sent to the drone for it 
   to fly

===============================================================================================
Wednesday, January 16, 2013

Team meeting during lab period (1pm). All members in attendance.
   -Discussed how to start doing the report 1 for this project 
   -Decided that the target android device we will use is a Nexus 7 since a 10 inch tablet feels to 
   big while flying the copter
   -Adam will get a nexus 7 tablet for development this evening
   -James updated us on his work with the avoidance system on the drone, did some sample command testing
   to get sample command data to implement from

===============================================================================================
Monday, January 21, 2013

James
   - Tried to connect to drone app
   - Discovered issue with packet parsing logic 
   - Fixed packet parsing
   - Added better logging functionality to diagnose issues in future

===============================================================================================
Wednesday, January 23, 2013

Team meeting during lab time (1pm.) All members attending. 

   - We discussed what James did yesterday, as noted in yesterday's entry. 
   - Based on Dr Smith's feedback, Jennifer constructed a list of specifications and limitations that need to be tested right away.  As a team, we came up with a plan to test all these things.  Adam had to go to class at 2pm, and James Jen and Rami did the following testing:

Performed sensor platform testing
   - Recorded entire test procedure to video
   - Will use for Part 1 of the Iteration 2 video deliverable
   - Collected data to determine sensor envelope

Data Collected:
   Important Findings
   - The 'copter picks up the ground at a certain distance, limiting maximum detection range
      - We tested with the 'copter 150cm off the ground, giving floor readings of ~400cm

   - We need for additional sensors for full frontal coverage
      - Sensors DO NOT have 45-degree visibility

   Binder Test
   - Reports correct distances up to range limit (2m)

   We Noticed that the ground is detected; all sensors report ~2m
   - Raised copter to get better ground clearance (initially 107cm, now 150cm)

   Small Box Test
   - Was detectable to 220cm

   Just the test arm
   - Was detectable to 120cm

   Binder test (again)
   - Was detectable to 300cm

   Piece of Cardboard Test
   - Was detectable to 350cm

   Human Test
   - Detectable the whole range, up to where the ground is seen

   Detection Time
   - Negligable latency (see iPhone video for specifics)

   Angle Test
   - Placed binder on perpendicular line, 1m from 'copter, walked it sideways until detected
   - Results indicate horizontal distance at which it was visible

            [Copter]
               |
               |
            1m |
               |  15cm (the reading reported below)
              -|-------|
               |       [Binder, moving <= that way]

   - Binder @ 1m => 15cm
   - Binder @ 2m => 50cm
   - Binder @ 3m => Barely Detectable
   - Human @ 2m => 70cm
   - Human @ 1m => 75cm
   - Human @ 3m => 90cm
   - Back Human @ 2m => 110cm
   - Back Human @ 1m => 80cm

   Approach Tests, with rear sensor
   - We were curious if the cowling around the front of the 'copter was interfering
     with readings 
   - We rotated the 'copter, repeated tests with the rear sensor 

   - Human was OK for entire range
   - Binder made it to 290cm, similar to initial test
   - Angle tests reported similar readings

   "Just after takeoff" tests
   - We were curious how the sensors behave just after takeoff

   - Moved 'copter down to ~60cm off the ground
   - All sensors reporting ~230cm

   - Human Test stalled out around 230cm as expected

   Other test to do - wall angle tests?
   - Will need to do outside, when we have more time.

Began developing script for second video

===============================================================================
Sunday January 27

Adam - worked on modifications to AR.FreeFlight app
   - Removed unused yadrone framework from depot
   - Removed temporary android app from depot
   - Other misc cleanup
   - Added FreeFlight2 app, along with ARDroneLib
   - Discovered issue with absolute control mode
   - Began removing app's ability to use compass to navigate for absolute control mode
   - Updated git configuration to exclude build files
   - Compass tweak didn't fix absolute control mode
   - Discussed with James - don't need absolute mode
   - Removed absolute control mode from application entirely
   - Set up deploy.sh to push .apk to the tablet easily

===============================================================================
Tuesday January 29

Adam - worked on app
   - Changed branding to custom "team lunch" images so we don't get confused
     between modified app and original app
   - Removed un-necessary menu options on homescreen
   - Added menu option to upload autonomous collision avoidance firmware

===============================================================================
Wednesday January 30

Team Meeting Minutes: (1pm, All members present.)

Work completed since last meeting:

Notes for the meeting:
   - Considered buying a second tablet to make app development easier. We're having trouble 
     sharing time to allow us all to have a chance with the tablet.  We expect that we will 
     have enough funds in the budget to allow for this.
   - Jen analyzed the test data and entered into the report.  
   - Focusing on Report 1 today; we split up the last bits of the report.  Rami and James will 
     produce the images and diagrams.  James will also elaborate on hardware and collision 
     avoidance design.  Rami will write the app design. Jennifer will complete health and 
     safety analysis, schedule, and high level design specs.  Adam will complete budget, copy 
     in introduction and rework it.  Note that while these sections were what we were each 
     responsible for, we all contribute to any part of the paper we feel requires elaboration 
     or improvement.  Jennifer will do the final revision / formatting of the paper and Adam 
     will be responsible for handing it in.

===============================================================================
Wednesday February 6th

Team Meeting Minutes: (1pm, all members present)
   - Had our midterm meeting with Dr Haque on Monday.  We reviewed our report and found that we 
     needed to number our sections.  Additionally, he would like us to provide a detailed parts 
     list with the cost of each component in our budget.
   - We requested not to be supervised by Mike Smith, as we felt he focused to much on the 
     hardware components of our project, and had a different idea of the scope of our system.
   - Dr Haque would like us to meet with our academic advisor, so we will set up an appointment.
   - Updates on app development
   - Updates on collision avoidance
   - Discussion on keeping up with logbook 
   - Debriefing on Report 1: we feel we did a good job completing requirements for the paper, 
     and do not think we could have avoided the aspects of it which cost us marks, due to 
     lack of knowledge on additional requirements.

Work completed since last meeting:
   - Rami and James produced the images and diagrams.  
   - James wrote hardware and collision avoidance design.  
   - Rami wrote the app design. 
   - Jennifer wrote health and safety analysis, schedule, and high level design specs.  She 
     did the final edit and review of the paper.
   - Adam wrote budget, copied and reworked the introduction.  He also handed in the report.
   - Note that while these sections were what we were each responsible for, we all contributed 
     to the overall paper.

To Do for next week:
   - Jen will update the logbook with all our offline materials.
   - Rami will set up a meeting with our Academic Advisor, Dr Krishnamurthy.
