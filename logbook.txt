James did some general setup:
   - Suggested a logo for the team
   - Created a this logbook on GitHub
   - Uploaded the "Iteration -1" project, including the cross-compiled libusb and libphidgets

The team had a start-up meeting, and discussed the following items:

General Discussion:
   - We need to distribute the VM Image to everyone
   - We already have our toolchain for the quadcopter
      - But not for the Tablet... worry about this later
   - James made a website at http://teamlunch.github.com
   - Everyone wants to code/write reports - we won't be specializing within the team
   - Everyone needs to make sure they're comfortable with using Git

Purchasing;
   - Right now, have one copter, one sensor controller, one IR sensor, one ultrasonic sensor
   - We should get a second one so we can keep working if we break the first one

Project Methodology and Scheduling:
   - We'll use Agile to drive the project; submit reports as necessary

Coding Conventions:
   - Use CDL Standards
      - Tabs are 3 spaces
      - Curly-braces on their own lines
      - Constants are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
      - ClassNamesAreCamelCase, membersStartsWithALowerCase
      - membersHaveAnUnderscoreAtTheEnd_
      - if (statementsHaveASpaceBeforeTheBracket)
      - Aim for lots of small functions
      - Acryonyms are capitalized like words (i.e. it's OpenGl, not OpenGL)

How we'll get started on the actual project:
   - Get Rami, Adam and Jennifer compiling on the VM
   - Start by making a proxy server that just eats commands

   We might be able to break the project into three things:
      - The software on the drone
      - The physical sensors
      - Unit/Acceptance Testing

   We'll discuss this more on Wednesday, once everyone has the VM.

Action Items:
   - Jennifer will write a draft of our Team Constitution
   - James will buy one more quadcopter
   - James will get a real copy of CDL's coding conventions
